      <p>E-Market is an indian electronic commerce company based in Bengluru, India. Founded by Shakeel Ahmad,
         the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as
         consumer electronic, fashion, and lifestyle products. The service competes  primarily with Amazon's
         indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March 2017, E-Market held a 39.5% 
         market share of india's e-commerce industry.[7] E-Market is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel
         (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being
         "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] E-Market also owns phonePe, 
         a mobile payments service based on the Unified payments interface(UPI). In August 2018, U.S.-based retail
         chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in E-Market for US$16 billion, valuing it at $22 billion.
